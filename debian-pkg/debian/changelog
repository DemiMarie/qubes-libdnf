    + Refresh.
    + Add 800000_libdnf_conf_ConfigMain.cpp_revert-
          9309e92332241ff1113433057c969cebf127734e-
          93a6b2d24433df040221de8423c621eedbdc6d4f.patch applied to the Fedora
      rawhide package to not always use the best solution/version for
      better compatibility.
    + Add 800100_libdnf_dnf-rpmts.cpp_revert-consequences-of-fail-safe-
          mechanism-af4874e2f190f9c6b45a57e660aa978855c5316e.patch applied to
      the Fedora rawhide package to not let actions fails if a modular package
      doesn't have modular metadata - likewise for better compatibility.
    + Add 100000_libdnf_utils_smartcols_Cell.hpp_use-private-
          scols_cell_get_alignment.patch to be able to use the private
      smartcols symbol from older util-linux packages. Goes with a change to
      debian/rules.
    + Add 000600_docs_libdnf_CMakeLists.txt_force-target-order.patch to force
      a specific target ordering when generating docs using gtk-doc.
    + Add
      000900_docs_libdnf_CMakeLists.txt_drop-html-topdir-when-installing.patch
      to not create an erroneous "html" top directory in the
      /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/libdnf directory.
    + Add 700000_docs_libdnf_Doxyfile.in_help-reproducible-builds.patch for
      making builds (really the documentation) more reproducible.
  * debian/libdnf-doc.docs:
    + Remove MAINTAINERS and NEWS, they are gone.
    + Install html documentation.
  * debian/rules:
    + Add new cmake parameters.
    + Don't run tests with valgrind. It would be nice to do so eventually, but
      they are currently failing in a spectacular fashion, c.f.,
      https://github.com/rpm-software-management/libdnf/issues/783 and
      https://github.com/rpm-software-management/libdnf/issues/784 .
      Note that the general test suite is still executed - only the broken
      valgrind tests are disabled!
    + During python3-build, also build the new doc targets (doxygen, gtkdoc).
    + Do not use recursive rm when deleting libdnf/dnf-version.h.
    + Make dh_missing fail on uninstalled files.
    + Same for dh_install, but only when using dh < 12.
    + Support older libsmartcols/util-linux versions by declaring the private
      symbol or comment the declaration out if the dependency is new enough.
    + Create temporary home directory for running test cases (and the enclosed
      rpmdb) in debian directory and use during dh_auto_test.
    + Remove LIB_INSTALL_DIR, it's not used any longer.
    + Remove dh-gir usage.
    + Fix dh_installchangelogs failure by excluding the (docs/)history
      directory.
    + Work around #841148 by renaming a file back to _module.
    + Remove integrated copies of {jquery,underscore}.js.
    + Drop Python 2 support.
    + Quote $@ variable in dh call.
  * debian/:
    + Remove gir1.2-libdnf-1.0.install.
    + Add python3-libdnf.{install,symbols}.
    + Add libdnf2-common.install.
    + Add libdnf-doc.links.
    + Add libdnf-doc.install.
    + Add libdnf1.lintian-overrides.
    + Add python3-hawkey-doc.links.
    + Add {libdnf,python3-hawkey}-doc.doc-base.
    + Remove libdnf1.symbols.
    + Add libdnf2.symbols.
    + Add source/lintian-overrides.
    + Add libdnf2.lintian-overrides.
  * debian/libdnf-dev.install:
    + Remove GIR path.
  * debian/libdnf1.install:
    + Remove GIR typelib entry.
    + Add entry for usr/lib/*/libdnf/plugins/.
  * debian/libdnf1.install:
    + Rename to libdnf2.install.
  * debian/python3-hawkey.symbols:
    + Update.
    + Add Build-Depends-Package tag mentioning libdnf-dev package.
  * debian/libdnf2-common.install:
    + Install locales.
  * debian/libdnf-doc.links:
    + Install gtk-doc symlink for libdnf.
  * debian/libdnf-doc.install:
    + Install gtk-doc data.
  * debian/libdnf1.lintian-overrides:
    + Silence outdated tag. oldlibs/optional is just fine.
  * debian/python3-hawkey-doc.links:
    + Replace {jquery,underscore}.js with system versions.
  * debian/python3-hawkey-doc.docs:
    + Adapt to new build directory.
  * debian/libdnf-doc.doc-base:
    + Register C interface documentation with doc-base.
  * debian/python3-hawkey-doc.doc-base:
    + Register Python interface documentation with doc-base.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    + Silence warning about an "empty" section. Debian wants to ignore the
      existence of COPYING (and licensing) files, but I don't.
  * debian/libdnf2.lintian-overrides:
    + Silence warning about stray documentation file. The installed README file
      actually describes the directory's usage, so that's fine.
  * debian/libdnf2.symbols:
    + Populate.
    + Add Build-Depends-Package tag mentioning libdnf-dev package.
